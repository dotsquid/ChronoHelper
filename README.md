ChronoHelper is a free open-source tool for Unity Editor for controlling TimeScale in PlayMode with ease.
It becomes very handy when it’s required to examine a suspicious moment of gameplay in slow-motion or conversely when it’s preferable to skip uninteresting part in fast-forward.  

## Usage
Use ‘Window/ChronoHelper’ menu to open ChronoHelper.  
To change current timeScale use the slider or shortcut buttons.  
While being in EditorMode, ChronoHelper is inactive. That is done to protect the user from accidental changing of Time.timeScale project setting.

You can add, remove and modify shortcut buttons as well as change other preferences in the Settings window.
